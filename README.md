# Odin Message Board
## [Live Deployed Site](https://odin-message-board-production-a8bc.up.railway.app/)
This is the odin message board project. It normally isn't supposed to use React, but I already had a plan to make a message component, so I'm using it. Shoutout to [ryxnseamxn](https://github.com/ryxnseamxn), from whom I stole the idea of resetting to messages every couple of minutes to prevent spam.

#### Technologies
This site is created with a React front-end, and an Express backend. A lot of JavaScript.

#### Future Plans
- It would be cool to actually have image uploading. This would require more storage space, however, and I don't have enough money to pay for that. But it would be cool
- Rate limiting/full message sanitization so that the messages don't have to be cleared every couple of minutes. I just know things could go awry.

#### What I learned
I learned a lot about backend development and routing, specifically with Express. I had never used express before this project, but I had done back-end development through Java or Next.JS's strange hybrid server-side stuff. But Express is very nice to use due to how simple it is.
